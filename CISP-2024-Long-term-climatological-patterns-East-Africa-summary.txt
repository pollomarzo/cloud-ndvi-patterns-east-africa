The study investigates climate-vegetation dynamics in the Juba-Shabelle basin using AVHRR v5 and VIIRS v1 NDVI data. Cloud coverage's impact on regional NDVI estimates is analyzed for sustainable resource management. Satellite sensors, crucial for assessing vegetation dynamics, reveal seasonal NDVI and cloud variations and long term spatial distribution. Results show increased pixel loss during rainy seasons due to clouds, highlighting their impact on vegetation estimates. The study underscores the importance of understanding land-atmosphere interactions for sustainable management, suggesting methods to mitigate cloud impact on NDVI calculations. Future research may focus on El Niño's lag correlation with NDVI, aiding food security predictions.
